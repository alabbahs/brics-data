## Data

This project is for a wide variety of economic metrics (pertatining to the BRICS countries) provided by a dataset I found on Kaggle, here is the description found on kaggle, along with the link to the website.

### Description
This dataset comprises 348 files, each representing a unique economic indicator for the BRICS nations—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa—spanning from 1970 to 2020. The dataset includes a wide array of economic metrics such as government consumption expenditure, GDP growth, adjusted savings, and various other national accounts data. This comprehensive dataset is ideal for economic research, financial analysis, and policy evaluation, offering a robust foundation for exploring economic trends and making data-driven decisions.

## Motivations

The clarity surrounding what I want to do with this data is is still foggy given the sheer vastness of the number of metrics in the dataset and what this data represents, the general idea is to clean the data and display it in order to observe the possible emergent trends, I am currently thinking of perhaps tying current news surrounding each brics country and tying those stories to the data, for example changes in economic policies in brazil or articles by the economist, etc.

For now things are open ended.
