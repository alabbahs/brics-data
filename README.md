# brics-data project

## Data

This project is for a wide variety of economic metrics (pertatining to the BRICS countries) provided by a dataset I found on Kaggle, here is the description found on kaggle, along with the link to the website.

### Description
The dataset on kaggle that inspired this project will no longer be used given that there is a large amount of missing data that can't be imputated effectively and is available in the world bank API, so I will be extracting the individual economic metrics myself using the world bank API, the link to the api will be placed below, the goal will be to extract the most important economic metrics for each of the relevant countries.

## Motivations

The clarity surrounding what I want to do with this data is is still foggy given the sheer vastness of the number of metrics in the dataset and what this data represents, the general idea is to clean the data and display it in order to observe the possible emergent trends, I am currently thinking of perhaps tying current news surrounding each brics country and tying those stories to the data, for example changes in economic policies in brazil or articles by the economist, etc.

For now things are open ended.
